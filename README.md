# Movies App

A React project that uses an API for viewing and searching movies and series information.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to browse, search, and filter movies and series from the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference).
Users can also view the details, ratings, and cast of each movie or series. The project uses React for the front-end, and Material UI for the styling.

## Usage

#### The app has a simple and intuitive interface. On the homepage, you can see a list of popular movies and series, which you can scroll through using the arrows.
